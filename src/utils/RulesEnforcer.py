        Evaluates the outcome of a match between two player choices using the rule set.
        If multiple rules match, an exception is raised due to ambiguity.

        Scaling Note:
        This implementation uses a linear scan over the rules for each check.
        With a small rule set (10â€“50), this is acceptable.
        However, if you had 1,000+ rules or needed high-throughput evaluations,
        consider indexing rules by (winner, loser) or (choice1, choice2) tuples
        to reduce lookup time using a dictionary.
